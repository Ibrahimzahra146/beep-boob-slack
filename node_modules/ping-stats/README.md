# Ping-Stats
A Node.js library wrapper around the ping command for use within Node.js. 
Unlike the majority of the ping libraries out there, this one returns not only if the ping was considered successful
and the host is "alive", it also returns a JSON object containing the actual results of the ping including the 
actual textual result of the ping command as well as the parsed values for the minimum, average, maximum, and standard
deviation for the ping response times.

Operating Systems Supported: OS X, CentOS, Ubuntu (Windows with some more work). 

This is an extension of the node-ping library created by Daniel Zelisko (http://github.com/danielzzz/node-ping) 
credit is due to him for the majority of the code base. If you need a Node.js library that simply returns a boolean
value indicating if the host responded to the ping command be sure to check out his library.

# Installation

npm install ping-stats --save

# Use

    ping.sys.probe(data.clientIp, function(results, err){
        if(err){
            logger.error(err, null);
        } else {
            // TODO: process results object
        }
    });
    
    
# Results

    var result = {
        host: addr,         // the host address for the system that was pinged
        code: code,         // the ping command result code
        isAlive: false,     // whether or not the host responded and the ping was considered successful
        output: outstring,  // the actual text that was output by the ping command
        stats: {
            min = 0;        // the minimum ping response time 
            avg = 0;        // the average ping response time
            max = 0;        // the max ping response time
            stddev = 0;     // the standard deviation for the ping response time
        }
    };
